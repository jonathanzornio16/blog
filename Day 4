I spent today finishing the tanks project, and I am very happy with how it came out.  The fact that it is a 2 player game makes it difficult to playtest in order to mess around with variables to my personal taste, but since this is just a practice project, that is not a big deal.  

Unlike the other two projects that I have worked on so far, this felt like a complete game.  Some of the effects were quite a bit flashier, such as making a health bar for each tank that changes color as it decreases and is represented by a circle that follows around the tank.  I also had my first experience working on mixing audio today.

The video tutorial was also recorded from a live presentation, which helped me pick up on a few tricks from digressions in the video that would not have been present in a scripted tutorial.  For example, searching "sou" will actually take you directly to audio source underneath the components menu, which are otherwise pretty hidden to find.

I think I will do one more practice project before starting on my own independant game.  I might also look at a few more tutorials for fun.
