Today, I decided that I wanted to do one of the 2D tutorials, as I figured that building a 2D game in unity would be significantly different, and it turns out that I was right.  I want to say that building a 2D game is overall easier than building a 3D game, but there are also parts that are added to it or significantly different, and because this is my first 2D game, it's definitely not a complete cruise.  I think it won't take too long though.  

The main thing that was different about the 2D rougelike tutorial was that it included a sprite package, and went into some detail about how to combine sprites into animations in Unity.  This reminds me a lot of what I had to do when using other game making software.  

I also worked on creating a new blog that would be neater than this to post these entries a bit today.  This site can be found at jonathanzornio16.github.io.

However, I found that the uses of being able to show code conveniently in GitHub seems to be lost when using a GitHub page.  It probably would have been better to use a more normal blogging site for this project.  I will probably finish setting up what I started tomorrow though.

I am thinking that my final game will be 3D, because making a 3D game feels like a better way to use the new skills that I've developed.  There are plenty of good ways to make 2D games.
