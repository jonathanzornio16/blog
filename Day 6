Today was rather annoying.  For most of the day, it looked like I was on track to finish the 2D Rougelike project with a little time to spare.  However, near the end of the tutorials, I ran into a nasty bug where the objects in the game won't recognize the GameManager object that is scripted to be generated at the start of the game.  I spent over an hour trying to fix this issue, and double checked all of my scripts.  However, I could not find anything.  

As the tutorial has only been checked against unity 5, and I am running unity 5.36, my guess is that the syntax for this might have changed.  Tomorrow, I am going to replace all of my scripts with all of the completed scripts that are included in the project and see if it results in a functional game.  

If it works, then I might search a little more to see what else I could have done wrong, but I also want to spend some time tomorrow preparing for the larger project at hand.  I am going to search the asset store to see if I can find some good free stuff, as most of the assets not connected to the tutorials seem to have a price tag on them.  It wouldn't be the end of the world if I had to create an idea for a game that was limited to the default asset packages in Unity and the ones I downloaded for the tutorials.  As it seems likely that there will be time for it, I will also get the GitHub page up and running.  I'm just not feeling it tonight after what I just went through.  I might alo review the end of the Space Shooter tutorial that explained how to upload games to the web and see in advance if I can make that happen.  That would definitely be a nice thing to have.
